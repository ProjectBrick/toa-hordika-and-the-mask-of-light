<line>Thank you, Whenua! You were just in time.</line>
<line>Well, somebody has to save you.</line>
<line>Why are you holding a Makoki stone?</line>
<line>We have been given a great mission by the Rahaga. You must find the stone hidden in the Archives.</line>
<line>Hmm...the Archives are heavily patrolled by the Visorak - no matter! I will meet with you and the others once I have the stone!</line>
<line>Until we meet again!</line>
