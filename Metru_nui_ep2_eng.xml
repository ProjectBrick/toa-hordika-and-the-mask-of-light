<line>Onewa! How...?</line>
<line>Thought you might need a hand there.</line>
<line>How did you end up in such danger anyway?</line>
<line>I am on a mission for Rahaga Norik. We have to find the six Makoki stones.</line>
<line>They will lead us to the Mask of Light.</line>
<line>Go quickly to Po-Metru and find the second Makoki stone.</line>
<line>Of course, Vakama; I will meet with you and the others once I have the stone.</line>
