<line>Thank you, Vakama!</line>
<line>The Visorak want to steal the secret to a great object of power from us.</line>
<line>But you have defeated them!</line>
<line>These tablets contain information on an incredible Mask of Power -</line>
<line>the Mask of Light!</line>
<line>We brought it to Metru Nui and have hidden it</line>
<line> to keep it safe from Roodaka and the Visorak!</line>
<line>To unlock its hiding place, you must find the six Makoki stones</line>
<line>that we have hidden throughout Metru Nui.</line>
<line>You and the other Toa Hordika must hurry!</line>
<line>Yes, Rahaga - we will find the stones and retrieve the mask!</line>
<line>If the Visorak find the mask first, all hope for the future is lost!</line>
